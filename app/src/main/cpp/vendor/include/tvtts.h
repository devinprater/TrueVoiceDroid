/*
 * TruVoice as a library.
 *
 * A flat C API over the decompiled Centigram TruVoice engine, meant for
 * screen readers and anything else that wants the synthesizer without
 * SAPI: no COM, no registry, no window messages, no threads, and no audio
 * device.  The caller drives synthesis on its own thread and plays the
 * samples itself, which is what a screen reader wants -- it already owns
 * its output device, its ducking and its cancellation.
 *
 * The shape is deliberately close to eSpeak's: one callback receives audio
 * and index marks interleaved in stream order, and returning non-zero from
 * it aborts synthesis at once.
 *
 *   tvtts_synth *s = tvtts_create(11025);
 *   tvtts_set_voice(s, 0);
 *   tvtts_speak_utf8(s, "Hello world.", on_event, NULL);
 *   tvtts_destroy(s);
 *
 * Thread safety: a tvtts_synth is not thread safe; give each thread its
 * own.  tvtts_add_lexicon is process-global (the engine's user lexicon is
 * a single static table) and is not thread safe against anything.
